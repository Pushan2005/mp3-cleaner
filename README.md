# MP3 Cleaner Tool

The MP3 Cleaner Tool is a script designed to remove all metadata from MP3 files.

Have you ever received a folder of MP3 songs from a friend or downloaded them yourself to play in your car? Are you annoyed by album cover images with website watermarks and prefer a clean display?

This tool can help you achieve that peace of mind :)

`Note : This script was written for a very specific personal usecase`

## Usage

1. Place the `main.py` and `requirements.txt` files into the folder containing all your MP3 files.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the script using one of the following commands:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    python3 main.py
    ```
